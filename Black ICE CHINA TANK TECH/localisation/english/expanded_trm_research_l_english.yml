 trm_armour_chi_folder_desc:0 "The earliest military unit in the Chinese army to be equipped with tanks was the Northeast Army. During the period of warlord turmoil in the Beiyang era, the Northeast Army was equipped with French Renault FT light tanks. In 1935, the Nationalist government purchased 32 artillery vehicles and amphibious tanks from Britain and established the Tank Training Battalion. After the end of the Battle of Songhu in 1937, the Chinese army once again formed armored units, namely the Tank Regiment of the National Revolutionary Army's 200th Division. After the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941, the United States provided aid to the Chinese army to once again form the armored units of the Chinese Expeditionary Force, inflicting heavy blows on the Japanese army in Burma. Throughout the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese armored units grew from weak to strong, enduring numerous hardships and bloodshed. For national independence and freedom, the Chinese armored units never bowed down or retreated from the Japanese invaders."

 tech_trm_weapon_mg_chi_02_hotchkiss_desc:0 "The Hotchkiss M1914 heavy machine gun (Hotchkiss = Hotchkiss) was developed by the Hotchkiss company established by Benjamin B. Hotchkiss, an American. In 1867, Hotchkiss came to France and established the Hotchkiss company in 1875, but he passed away on February 14, 1885. In 1892, a Swedish officer published a design for a gas-operated firearm, and the Hotchkiss company bought the copyright for this design, leading to the development of the Hotchkiss M1897 heavy machine gun. During the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, the Japanese army used the Hotchkiss M1897 heavy machine gun in combat. The Hotchkiss M1914 heavy machine gun is an improved version of this model. Between 1930 and 1940, China purchased a large number of this machine gun. Between 1930 and 1937, 1,192 units were imported, and after 1937, another 1,300 units were imported. Before the fall of France in 1940, another 300 units were delivered, totaling around 2,800 units. Additionally, there were many domestic imitations, with records of imitations in Guangdong and Shanxi's military factories."

 tech_trm_weapon_c_chi_37_sa18_desc:0 "The Puteaux SA-18 37mm tank gun was a vehicle gun designed by France during World War I, primarily equipped on the Renault FT-17 tank. This is a simple yet destructive artillery piece. It was mainly used against infantry and machine gun positions. Due to its low muzzle velocity, it could not be used as an effective anti-armor weapon. Although its weak penetration power could not pose a threat to armored units, before 1939, it was more than sufficient to deal with some lightly armored vehicles. It could be operated by a single soldier, offering ease of use and resistance to interference."

The NII-24 design bureau developed a hard core armor-piercing round for 45mm artillery based on this design. There are records of the Soviet Union using 45mm anti-tank guns to penetrate the 62mm thick lower side of a Tiger tank at a range of 500 meters."
