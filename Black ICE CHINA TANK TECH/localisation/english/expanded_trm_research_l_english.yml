 trm_armour_chi_folder_desc: "The first Chinese units to be equipped with tanks were those of the Northeast Army, which operated French Renault FT light tanks during the Warlord Era.\nIn 1935, the Nationalist Government purchased 32 armored vehicles and amphibious tanks from Britain, forming the Tank Instruction Battalion.\nFollowing the Battle of Shanghai in 1937, the Chinese military reorganized its armored forces into the Tank Regiment of the 200th Division.\nWith the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941, American aid facilitated the creation of the Chinese Expeditionary Force's armored units, which dealt heavy blows to the IJA in Burma.\nThroughout the War of Resistance, the Chinese armored forces evolved from a fledgling wing into a battle-hardened corps. For the sake of national independence and freedom, they never bowed nor retreated before the Japanese invaders."

 tech_trm_weapon_mg_chi_02_hotchkiss_desc: "The Hotchkiss M1914 was developed by the Hotchkiss company, founded by American Benjamin B. Hotchkiss. Based on a gas-operated design purchased from a Swedish officer in 1892, it became a staple of French military hardware. The Imperial Japanese Army notably used the earlier M1897 variant during the Russo-Japanese War.\nBetween 1930 and 1940, China imported approximately 2,800 units from France. Additionally, domestic arsenals in Guangdong and Shanxi produced numerous local copies of this reliable machine gun."
