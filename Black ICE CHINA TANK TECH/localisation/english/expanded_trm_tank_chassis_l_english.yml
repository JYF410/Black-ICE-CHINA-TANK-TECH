 trm_light_tank_chassis_chi_ft17_desc: "The Renault FT, a French light tank produced during World War I, is a true pioneer in armored warfare. Originally equipped with an 8mm Model 1914 machine gun, it provided reliable support for infantry with its 6-22mm armor.\nUnder the leadership of Zhang Zuolin, the Northeast Army equipped a significant number of these tanks, many of which were refitted with 7.92mm ZB-26 light machine guns manufactured by the Brno arsenal. Following the Northeast Flag Substitution, Zhang Xueliang gifted two FT tanks to the Nanjing government for training. One was eventually captured by the Japanese during the Battle of Nanjing in 1937 and taken to Japan for exhibition as a trophy of war."

Soong ordered 18 units for the Salt Administration's anti-smuggling units, forming the core of China's first modern armored force. Though the government was hesitant to deploy these 'precious treasures' early in the conflict, the crews were eager for combat. The unit met its end during the defense of Nanjing in 1937, where most were destroyed or captured.\nThis chassis can be refitted into the VCL M1931 Amphibious Tank by researching Floatation Equipment."
